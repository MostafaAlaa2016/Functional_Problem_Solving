# Functional_Problem_Solving

Trials for problem solving using scala functional programming way. Note: you can find some code without functional programming style. However, I am working to convert it to functional way.

The main purpose of this repo is as following:

1- Enhance my problem solving skills.
2- Enhance my function programming thinking skill.
